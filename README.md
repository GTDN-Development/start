This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This project uses **[Bun](https://bun.sh)** as the JavaScript runtime and package manager.

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```


## Prerequisites

Install Bun if you haven't already:
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Windows
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Installation
```bash
bun install
```

### Development

Run the development server:
```bash
bun dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


### Build
```bash
bun run build
```

### Production
```bash
bun start
```



This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
